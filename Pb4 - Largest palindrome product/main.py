Context : A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Goal : Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# palindromes we find and try to factor them into two 3-digit numbers. As soon as we are able to find one number which

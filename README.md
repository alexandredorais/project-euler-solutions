# project-euler-solutions
A place to gather all of my solutions to the math/programming problems found on : https://projecteuler.net/archives

The repo is divided into directories, each containing a solution to one of the problems on the Project Euler site. Each directory is numbered according to the ID which can be found on the aforementioned website, along with a short title to facilitate the search for a particular problem in the repo.

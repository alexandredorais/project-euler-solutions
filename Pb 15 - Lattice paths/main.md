# Solution
No need for a program to solve this problem. We only need to notice that every valid path through the 20x20 grid is composed of exactly 20 "right" moves and 20 "down" moves. The only thing that changes from one path to the other is the order in which these steps are taken. Therefore, the total number of paths is the number of ways to place 20 "down" moves within the 40 spots in the route. From combinatorics, we know this is written as 40 choose 20, and it is given by $\frac{40!}{(20!20!)}$. 

This is because there are 40! ways to choose the order of moves if they are all labeled (e.g: right1, right2, ..., down1, down2, ..., down20). However, they aren't actually labeled, therefore switching any two "down" moves with each other doesn't change the current path, and switching any two "right" moves with each other doesn't change the path either. There are 20! ways to place the labeled "down1", "down2", ..., "down20" moves within their 20 spots, and 20! ways for the "right" moves too, which explains why we divide by $(20!)^2$.
